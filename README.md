# Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification

## Offered By: DeepLearning.AI and Stanford University

### Background

This is a beginner-friendly online course called "Machine Learning Specialization" created by DeepLearning.AI and Stanford Online, taught by AI expert Andrew Ng. The course covers the fundamentals of machine learning and how to use techniques to build real-world AI applications. The course includes three parts and covers topics like supervised and unsupervised learning, multiple linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, decision trees, clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, and best practices used in Silicon Valley. By completing this course, learners will gain practical knowledge and skills to apply machine learning to real-world problems.


There are 4 projects associated with this course covering the following topics: 
1. Logistic Regression
2. Multi-Class Classification and Neural Networks
3. Regularized Regression and Bias/Variance
4. Support Vector Machines

This repository contains code I developed and modified for these projects as a part of this course.

### Skills Covered: 
1. Regularization to Avoid Overfitting
2. Gradient Descent
3. Supervised Learning
4. Linear Regression
5. Logistic Regression for Classification
